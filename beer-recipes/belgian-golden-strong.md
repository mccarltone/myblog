I intended on this beer to be a Belgian Blonde but it dried out more than I intended. The resulting beer was quite good and reminded me of Duvel somewhat.

### Grist

| Malt Name   | Percent of Grist |
|-------------|------------------|
| Pilsner     | 76%              |
| White Wheat | 15%              |
| Biscuit     | 7%               |
| Cane Sugar  | 2%               |

### Hops

| Hop    | Amount  | Alpha | Time   | IBU   |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Lublin | 1.25 oz | 4.7   | 60 min | 20.22 |

I used Lubin because I had a good bit of it in the freezer. Any saaz-type hop would work well here.

### Water Chemistry

| Calcium (ppm) | Magnesium (ppm) | Sodium (ppm) | Sulfate (ppm) | Chloride (ppm) | Bicarbonate (ppm) |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 60            | 5               | 10           | 55            | 95             | 0                 |

### Yeast

I've been experimenting with dry yeast as of late and decided on [Safale BE-256](https://fermentis.com/en/fermentation-solutions/you-create-beer/safale-be-256/). It was a vigorous fermenter and got my FG down within a couple of days.
