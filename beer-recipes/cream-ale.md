So here's the recipe I use for my house cream ale. I have this on draft a good bit of the time since it's a favorite of everyone and it's not too difficult to make.

### Grist

| Malt Name   | Percent of Grist |
|-------------|------------------|
| 2-Row       | 45%              |
| Pilsner     | 45%              |
| Flaked Corn | 10%              |

### Hops

As for hops, I use whatever I have on hand that would fit the style (some type of American hop). Try to stay around 10 IBU with a 60 minute and 10 minute addition. I've used Cascade and Willamette with good success.

### Water Chemistry

For you water gurus, here's what I usually aim for...

| Calcium (ppm) | Magnesium (ppm) | Sodium (ppm) | Sulfate (ppm) | Chloride (ppm) | Bicarbonate (ppm) |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 50            | 10              | 5            | 105           | 45             | 0                 |

### Yeast

Any American ale yeast would work. [Safale US-05](https://fermentis.com/en/fermentation-solutions/you-create-beer/safale-us-05/) never lets me down.
