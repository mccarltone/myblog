After having an altbier at [Quinn Brewing Company](http://quinnbrewing.com/), I was inspired to brew one of my own. My first ever all grain batch was an altbier and I remember it being quite enjoyable.

### Grist

| Malt Name   | Percent of Grist |
|-------------|------------------|
| Pilsner     | 64%              |
| Munich - 20L| 25%              |
| White Wheat | 9%               |
| Carafa II   | 2%               |

### Hops

| Hop    | Amount  | Alpha | Time   | IBU   |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Magnum |  .75 oz | 13.2  | 60 min | 37.5  |
| Lublin |    1 oz | 4.7   | 10 min | 6.45  |

Magnum is a great clean bittering hop and I highly recommend it. You get a good bit of bittering and less hop trub left in the fermenter.

### Water Chemistry

| Calcium (ppm) | Magnesium (ppm) | Sodium (ppm) | Sulfate (ppm) | Chloride (ppm) | Bicarbonate (ppm) |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 90            | 12              | 45           | 65            | 82             | 223               |

### Yeast

Decided on [Safale K-97](https://fermentis.com/en/fermentation-solutions/you-create-beer/safale-k-97/) for this one because, well, I've never used it before. Fermented relatively quickly and left a krausen behind that took a long time to drop. It finally dropped when I decided the beer was done fermenting and did a cold crash. Even with gelatin this yeast takes a long while to clear, so several weeks lagering this beer will do it wonders.
