Let’s see, here’s the stuff that I do…

* CAD Designer/CNC Operator guy
* Homebrewer
* BJCP Certified Beer Judge
* Husband and father to two very cool daughters
* Aspiring web developer (HTML, CSS, static site generators, etc.)
* Pseudo-chef
* Traveler of the northeast & midwest
* Lover of finding new restaurants and breweries

There might be more, but that’s all I can think of right now.
