### I'm so tired...

Spent the weekend enjoying many, many beers. Finished off my Belgian Golden Strong so I kegged up my Altbier. Checked in on my fermenting Cream Ale and it's likely done (gravity was at 1.004).

### Maybe this will work

| Ingredient   | Percent | Notes                   |
|--------------|---------|-------------------------|
| 2 Row Malt   | 45.5%   | Avanguard               |
| Pilsner Malt | 45.5%   | Avanguard               |
| Flaked Corn  | 9%      | I forget, not Special K |

This may work nicely. I may document my brew days on here.
