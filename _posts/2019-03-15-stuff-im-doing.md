### So here's what's going on...

I'm learning [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I was attempting [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) but I find javascript a tad daunting.

I'm brewing many things, such as a [cream ale](http://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/1/1C/cream-ale/), a [helles](http://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/4/4A/munich-helles/), and an [altbier](http://www.bjcp.org/style/2015/7/7B/altbier/) that's ready to go on tap shortly.

I'm redesiging the [WAZE](http://waze.jcbweb.com) homebrew club webpage to be more minimal.

We're in the initial planning stages for another competition called the [Fizzy Yellow Beer Cup](http://wazecomp.jcb.com/) that should be a lot of fun since it's styles that aren't too taking to judge.
